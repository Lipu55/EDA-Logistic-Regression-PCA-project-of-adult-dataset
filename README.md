Exploratory Data Analysis and Logistic Regression with PCA: Adult Dataset Analysis
# In this project, the objective is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build a logistic regression model using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Adult dataset. The Adult dataset contains demographic information about individuals, including features such as age, education, occupation, and income level.By performing EDA, applying PCA, and building a logistic regression model on the Adult dataset, this project aims to provide insights into the relationship between demographic factors and income levels. The results can be used to understand socioeconomic patterns, make data-driven decisions, and develop strategies to address income disparities and inequality.
